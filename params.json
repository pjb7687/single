{"name":"Single","tagline":"An ultimate single-molecule imaging program in C#","body":"Single\r\n======\r\n\r\nSingle is an easy-to-use single-molecule imaging program!\r\n\r\nSingle allows to control unlimited number of shutters,\r\nalso supports N-color alternate excitation(ALEX), automatic focusing, and automatic flow features.\r\n\r\nSingle is written in C#, and completely free to use.\r\n\r\nCompatible Hardwares\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Basic Imaging / ALEX\r\n  1. Any EMCCD from Andor.\r\n  2. Any ProEM EMCCDs from Princeton Instruments.\r\n  3. Counterboards from National Instruments(NI). Currently the program has been tested with NI PCI-6601/2 (http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/ko/nid/211875), however, The program uses NI standard interface (a.k.a. VISA, Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) to communicate with counterboards, so any VISA-compatible counterboards will work. For your information, PCI-6601 supports only 3 counters so you will need PCI-6602 (or above) if you want 4-color ALEX.\r\n  4. Any electronic shutters compatible with the counterboards. For ALEX FRET imaging, we have used VS35 series from Uniblitz (VS35S2T1-24).\r\n\r\n3. Automatic Focusing\r\n  1. Z-axis stages. Currently, MS-2000 control unit from Applied Scientific Instrumentation, C-Focus from Mad City Labs, and E-516 control unit from Physik Instrumente are supported. For more information, read this article: http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.20.029353\r\n\r\n4. Automatic Pump Control\r\n  1. Any Chemyx Fusion series syringe pumps.\r\n  2. Harvard PHD 2000 syringe pump.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n---\r\n1. All required device drivers (EMCCD, counterboards, Z-axis stages, etc.).\r\n2. NI VISA with Visual Studio Examples. To install it properly, you should *customize* your setup and ensure to install *Development Support*-*.Net Framework xxx Lauguages Support*-*Examples*. It installs not only examples but also required .Net DLLs. (FYI, Visual Studio 2010 == .Net 3.5, Visual Studio 2013 == .Net 4.0)\r\n3. NI DAQmx with Visual Studio Examples. To install it properly, you should *customize* your setup and ensure to install *Development Support*-*.Net Framework xxx Lauguages Support*-*Examples*. It installs not only examples but also required .Net DLLs.\r\n4. DotNet framework. If you have Visual Studio, then you can skip it.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Jeongbin Park\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1.
